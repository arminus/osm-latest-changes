# OSM Latest Changes

Recent changes in OpenStreetMap, the simple way.

See http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/lxbarth/diary/19185 for background.

## Running

Just `git clone` and [boot up a quick development server](https://gist.github.com/tmcw/4989751).

## Modifications

Slightly modified by tyr_asd to show only the edits of the last week. Not showing older items one may not be interested in helps saving bandwith and rendering time and/or allows lower zoom levels.
